# nvidiaRtx3080StockMonitor

A bit of fun - code for building a docker image for a wee app that monitors the NVidia Shop website for when the RTX 3080 does not appear to be out of stock anymore :)

sends you a text message - a friendly reminder to get you to check the shop

does not auto-buy or add to cart - i'll put that down to me not wanting to be a sneaky sneaker fiend, rather than lack of effort
